  <p>
    I start to <em>modularize</em> code, due to identify some patterns that let
    me see that a bunch of code it was been repited along all the code and some
    functios had a strong relation among them, based on this hypotesis I took
    the decision to work on each one using something called atomic design, where
    we have atoms(functios stored inside helpers folder), molecules(functions
    stored inside, services folder), organism(functions stored inside modules
    folder) and templates(union of all of them on the app folder)
